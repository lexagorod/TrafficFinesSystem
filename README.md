# TrafficFinesSystem

Repository to show how I write the code

"Record of traffic violations". A list of violations is stored in the database for each vehicle (and its owner). 
For each violation, the date, time, type of violation, and amount of fine are recorded. When all fines are paid,
the car is deleted from the database.
